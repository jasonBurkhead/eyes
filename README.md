# Eyes
## Exercise on eyes
<p>The eyes exercise uses a single effect that is doubled using a for loop.</p>
<p>I have added an additional animation in the CSS that makes the eyes blink every 5 seconds because I was worried about the eyes drying out. I'd like to add a mouth tothis little guy and get him talking to users.</p>
<p>licenses belong to MIT as they provided the base code for this exercise. I have worked on the loop and added the blink.</p>
